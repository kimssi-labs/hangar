/**
 * How the window's frame looks — the one pixel of window that is not page.
 *
 * Owned here and nowhere else, because it kept breaking from the outside: every change to where a
 * band is placed moved a hairline, and every place the window was shown from reset its colour. Three
 * facts, each measured on Windows 11 26200 with Electron 43, and each one a release that looked fine
 * in every geometry test:
 *
 * 1. DWM draws a 1 px border around a frameless window, top row included, and `DWMWA_COLOR_NONE`
 *    does not remove it — it paints #f3f3f3 (DEFAULT paints a translucent grey). A real colour is
 *    honoured, so a band's border is painted in the page's own background and cannot be told from it.
 * 2. Electron writes that colour itself — from the window's ACCENT colour — on every show and every
 *    change of activation. A colour written straight to DWM behind its back was therefore undone by
 *    the next show (a grey ring on every band restored at start-up) and by the next click elsewhere;
 *    writing it again from the `blur` event put it back two frames later, which is a flash. So the
 *    colour is not written to DWM at all: it is handed to Electron as the accent colour, and Electron
 *    keeps it (measured: no change of the border pixel at all across losing focus, or a hide/show).
 *    `false` is the system's own grey — what a window that is not a band wears.
 * 3. On a scaled display there is a second ring pixel that Chromium draws and no attribute reaches;
 *    it follows Chromium's own light/dark, which `nativeTheme.themeSource` sets. The page's theme is
 *    therefore mirrored into Chromium, and the window's background is the page's colour too.
 *
 * The geometry of a band lives in `dock.ts`; all it asks of this module is `flush(true)` when the
 * window becomes a band and `flush(false)` when it is a window again. The shell tells it the theme.
 * Guards: the unit tests beside this file, the boundaries test (this module imports no feature and
 * not dock), and the e2e pixel tests — "every monitor, every edge" and "restored at start-up".
