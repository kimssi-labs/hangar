/**
 * Docking — the main side.
 *
 * The reservation itself (Windows AppBar, X11 struts) and the geometry are main/dock.ts's `Dock`.
 * This is the feature's edge: it owns the one `Dock` instance and everything main used to do around
 * it — applying a saved band at start-up, re-applying when monitors come and go, saving a dragged
 * thickness, and answering the settings screen. Whether the window is a band is pushed from here on
 * every change, so the caption button can never again show a state nobody told it about.
 *
 * It borrows the window from the shell and hands back to the shell the one thing that is the
 * shell's: giving an undocked window a window's shape (`placeFloating`).
