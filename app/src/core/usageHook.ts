/**
 * Collecting Claude Code's usage figures, by asking Claude Code for them.
 *
 * The gauges read `cache/rate-limits.json`, and nothing in a stock install writes it: it appeared
 * on the author's machine only because a personal status-line script happened to publish it, so on
 * every other machine the gauges were silently blank however many sessions had run.
 *
 * Claude Code hands the current `rate_limits` to its Stop hook on stdin at the end of every turn,
 * piggybacked on a response it already made. Reading that costs nothing: no API call, and figures
 * current to the last turn. So the first source is a small hook of our own that writes the figures
 * where the gauges already look. It is off until asked for, though, and a machine where it never
 * was showed nothing; there core/usageEndpoint.ts asks Claude Code's own usage endpoint instead,
 * sparingly, with the login Claude Code keeps.
 *
 * A file rather than a POST to a port of our own — which is how a fleet manager with many panes to
 * attribute would do it — because this app is usually CLOSED. The hook keeps the file current
 * whether or not anything is listening, and the window shows today's numbers the moment it opens;
 * a socket would drop every turn that happened while the app was shut, which is most of them.
 *
 * Nothing here assumes a shell beyond the one the platform ships. The POSIX script is `sh` with
 * builtins; the Windows script is `cmd` reading stdin through `more.com`. No bash, no curl, no jq.
 *
 * `settings.json` is the user's file, so this is off until it is asked for, names itself where it
 * is written, and removes exactly what it added.
