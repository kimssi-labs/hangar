/**
 * What a transcript says about itself.
 *
 * `history.jsonl` looked like the cheap way to title a session — one file, every prompt, keyed by
 * session id — but it is not per-session reliable. Measured here: the first prompt a person typed
 * in one session is filed in that history under a *different* session id, one that has no
 * transcript at all. Titles taken from it drift to whatever prompt happens to be listed first.
 *
 * The transcript itself carries the truth, in entries Claude Code writes but never advertises:
 *
 *   {"type":"ai-title","aiTitle":"apiFuncGetStatus vs apiFuncGetSegmentStatus 차이", ...}
 *   {"type":"user","message":{...},"origin":{"kind":"human"},"promptSource":"typed"}
 *
 * `ai-title` is the name the terminal tab shows, refined as the conversation grows — 14 of 15
 * transcripts sampled had one. `origin.kind` separates a person typing from the caveats,
 * slash-command echoes, tool results and skill injections that are all also `type: "user"`.
