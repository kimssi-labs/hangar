# Changelog

Every release is built from the tag by CI, which uses the matching section below as the release
notes. Add the section **before** tagging.

## v2.16.0

- **The Claude usage gauges no longer need setting up, and no longer lose the per-model window.**
  The figures are read the way Claude Code's own `/usage` reads them — from the usage endpoint,
  with the login Claude Code already keeps. Nothing to install, no separate key, and nothing spent:
  it is a reading, not a model call. They refresh every minute while a Claude Code session is
  running, every ten minutes otherwise, and a double-click on any gauge reads them again at once.
- **The Stop hook that used to collect them is gone.** It was written to copy `rate_limits` from a
  hook's stdin, and Claude Code hands that field to no hook at all (checked against 2.1.263: none
  of its 33 hook events carries it). A hook an earlier version installed is removed at start-up —
  that entry and its script, and nothing else in your settings file.
- **The answer now lands in the app's own `cache/hangar-usage.json`.** It used to share
  `cache/rate-limits.json` with anything else that publishes Claude Code's figures — a status line,
  say — and each of those writes replaced the whole answer with the two windows Claude Code hands
  out, so the weekly window scoped to one model kept disappearing.
- **One settings card, "Claude usage", with On and Off.** It replaces the two cards that asked the
  same question twice. Off hides the gauges and stops the app asking for anything.
- **A narrow gauge keeps what fits.** An upright card measures its own text before drawing the
  second line: the reset time, the clock speed or the gigabytes are dropped only when they would
  overlap the card beside them, "1w Fable" shortens to "Fable", and the bar grows into the space
  the dropped line leaves so a row of gauges stays level.
- **A docked band on a fractional-scale monitor is cut to the screen Windows reports**, not to the
  size Electron converts from its DIP bounds, which can be two pixels taller than the monitor is.

## v2.15.1

- **Usage collection worked, and showed nothing, on a machine whose user name is not plain English.**
  The hook script carried the path it publishes to, and a Windows script is read in the console's
  code page — so a home with a Korean (or any non-ASCII) name in it became a path that does not
  exist. The hook ran every turn and wrote nowhere, while the settings card said "collecting". Both
  scripts now find the file from their own folder, and a script installed by an earlier version is
  brought up to date when Hangar starts.
- **The figures keep themselves current in the background.** They used to be fetched only while the
  window was asking; now the app keeps them up to date on its own, so a band that is docked or
  minimised has today's numbers the moment it is looked at. Nothing to install and nothing to switch
  on: at most one request every ten minutes, and none at all while something else is publishing them.

## v2.15.0

- **A conversation you `/clear` stays one row.** Claude Code's `/clear` starts a new session id in the
  same terminal and hands it the old session's name, so the list showed two rows named alike — one
  finished, one running. The finished one is now folded under its successor: the row is the newest
  transcript, the detail pane says how many came before it, and the first prompt is borrowed until a
  new one is typed. Only a named session is folded, and only under a successor of the same name;
  deleting the head row brings the earlier ones back.
- **Usage shows on any machine you are signed in on.** The gauges used to depend on a hook you had
  to switch on. When nothing has published the figures, or what was published is more than ten
  minutes old, Hangar now asks Anthropic's usage API directly — the same request Claude Code's own
  `/usage` makes, with the login Claude Code keeps, through the machine's proxy settings, at most once
  a minute. The token goes to api.anthropic.com and nowhere else, and is neither refreshed nor
  stored. The settings screen says which source wrote the figures, and — when there is nothing to
  show — whether the login is missing (an API-key machine) or has run out (run Claude Code once).
- **A third gauge for a weekly limit scoped to one model**, labelled after the model ("1w Fable"),
  when the account has one.
- Claude Code's own home override, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, is honoured when Hangar has none of its own.

## v2.14.1

- **On a 125 % display, a band docked to the right no longer sits one pixel off the screen.**
  Converting the band's rectangle to pixels rounded its position and its size separately, and for
  some widths the two roundings added up to a right edge one column past the screen; the reservation
  followed suit. The band is now cut to the monitor before anything else is decided.
- **A band docked to the bottom of a 125 % display no longer shows two rows of desktop above the
  taskbar.** The two-row correction for how such a display draws a window was applied to a band that
  did not need it; it now applies only where the window's top is not a whole DIP.
- **The remembered window size no longer grows on every launch at 125 %.** The size was saved with
  the frame in it and restored without, two DIP wider each time; the frame is taken off before
  remembering.

## v2.14.0

- **Double-clicking a running session shows it.** Until now the app only said the session was
  already running. Now its window comes to the front — restored if it was minimised, and in Windows
  Terminal with that session's tab selected — and nothing new is started. A session that is running
  with no window to show (Claude Code's own background sessions, a terminal that is gone) is offered
  a take-over: the dialog says whether it is working right now and that stopping it cuts off the
  response in progress, and on your word its process ends and the session continues in a new tab.
  The first use after an update builds a small helper once, a few seconds, in the background.
- **A screenshot's path is for terminals only.** The clipboard watch put a copied screenshot's path
  beside the picture, and Word — given a bitmap and a text — pastes the text, so Ctrl+V in a document
  gave a file name. The path is now there only while a terminal is the window in front and the
  clipboard goes back to the bare picture the moment another kind of window is; nothing else on the
  machine is affected.

## v2.13.0

- **The CPU clock moves.** It read 3.0 GHz whatever the machine was doing: the processor's base
  clock was asked of Windows through a slow query that gave up under load, and the fallback was the
  figure recorded at boot. The base clock is now read from the power manager directly, in an instant,
  so the live clock is there from the first sample and follows the load.
- **"This PC" and "Claude usage" are separate.** The CPU, memory and clock gauges belong to the PC
  monitor; the 5h and 1w gauges belong to Claude usage. Each panel follows its own setting in every
  shape of the window — before, turning the PC monitor off took the Claude usage gauges, and the whole
  side panel, down with it. The settings sections are named for what they are.
- **Quitting always quits.** Closing the window could end the process the way a crash does — measured
  on one exit in three: the measuring thread was cut off in the middle of a system call — and a
  process could stay behind with no window at all, which, since only one Hangar runs at a time, made
  the next launch hand over to the ghost and look as if Hangar would not start. The measuring thread
  now finishes its sample before the app leaves, every way out goes through the same door, and a
  watchdog ends a process that is still there ten seconds after its window closed.

## v2.12.2

- **Minimising a band gives its edge back.** The space a docked band takes is released while the
  window is minimised — that is the point of minimising — and taken again when the window comes back.
  The band stays docked; nothing changes in the settings.
- **Minimising a band no longer crashes the app.** Restoring a minimised band killed the process
  every time, in every version since the band existed. The band was being put back on its edge while
  minimised, which un-minimised it from inside that very call, and the code that then redrew the frame
  ran inside the first native call — which is not allowed. Nothing native runs from inside a window
  event any more, and a minimised band is left alone until it is restored.
- **The band's border no longer flickers when you click elsewhere.** v2.12.1 painted the border
  again after every focus change, one frame after Windows had repainted it grey — visible as a flash.
  The colour is now handed to Electron as the window's accent colour, which it keeps through focus
  changes and shows without any repainting of ours.
- On a 125 % display the two rows a bottom band sits above are now decided from the display's scale
  instead of read back from the window, which answered inconsistently.

## v2.12.1

- **The band's border stays the page's colour when you click elsewhere.** v2.12.0 gave the border
  its colour again whenever the window was shown, and that held until another window was chosen:
  Chromium also writes its own frame colour on every change of focus, so the band was right while it
  had the focus and wore a grey line the moment it lost it — which, for a band, is most of the time.
  The colour is now given again on focus and on blur as well.
- On a 125 % display, a band docked to the bottom could — now and then — show two rows of whatever
  was behind it along its top. How far such a window draws below itself was read back from the window,
  and the window did not always answer the same; it is now decided from the display's scale.

## v2.12.0

- **The grey ring around a band that comes back at start-up is gone.** v2.11.4 painted the band's
  border in the page's colour, and it was right whenever you docked from Settings — but a band the
  app restores when it starts is placed while the window is still hidden, and showing a window resets
  the border colour Windows was given. So the band you actually live with wore a wallpaper-tinted grey
  line on all four sides, top included, in both themes, and every test passed. The colour is now given
  again every time the window appears, including after a hide or a minimise.
- **One Hangar at a time.** Launching it again — the shortcut, or `claude --p` from another terminal
  — brings the running window to the front and exits, instead of opening a second one to fight over
  the same band and the same settings.
- The weekly usage gauge is labelled **1w**, and the time until a window resets reads with every unit
  from the first day on: `2d 5h 30m`, `3h 5m`, `42m`.
- Under the hood, how the window's frame looks is now one small module with its own tests, asked one
  question by the docking code and one by the shell. A change to where a band goes can no longer
  reach how its edge is drawn — which is how the last three releases each moved a hairline.
- Releases stay unsigned for now; see v2.11.4.

## v2.11.4

- **No more pale hairline around a docked band.** Windows offers a "no border" value for a window's
  frame, and it does not mean none: it paints #f3f3f3, which is invisible against a light desktop
  and a bright line around a dark band, most noticeably along the top. The band's border is now
  painted in the page's own colour and follows the theme, so the one pixel of window that is not
  page cannot be told from the page. On a scaled display there is a second pixel that Chromium draws
  and no setting of ours reaches; the app now tells Chromium which theme it is in, and that pixel
  follows too.
- **A band on a 125 % display no longer shows two rows of desktop.** Everything such a window draws
  lands a whole point below the window itself, unless the window is against the top of the screen —
  so a band docked to the bottom left two transparent rows at its top and painted two rows under the
  taskbar. The window is now placed that far above the band it reserves, and the band's open face is
  kept on the display's own grid, where a whole point is a whole pixel.
- The band is checked by what it looks like, not by where it is. A new test reads the reserved strip
  back from the screen on all four edges of every monitor: the border must be the page's colour and
  no edge pixel may be the desktop. A second one holds the modules apart, so a change to one feature
  cannot start depending on another's insides — the two together are what stop this class of fault
  coming back.
- Releases stay unsigned for now. Windows may warn about an unknown publisher when you download an
  installer by hand; updates from inside the app are unaffected and are still checked against their
  published hash.

## v2.11.3

- **No more hairline of desktop along a docked band.** The band was placed exactly right: Windows
  reports its painted frame flush with the monitor on every edge, to the pixel. But from Electron 43
  the page sits one pixel inside that frame on the left, the right and the open face — the room
  Windows keeps for the window's border, which a band switches off, so what showed through was the
  wallpaper. The band is now placed and measured by the page itself, which is what a band is. The
  window's own background colour was also a shade off the page's, which is what made the sliver
  visible while it lasted.
- **The band's open face can be dragged again.** The grip is a strip in the page rather than a
  window edge, and in v2.11.2 it had no size at all: it moved to a folder the stylesheet was not
  built from, so its classes existed in the markup and nowhere in the CSS.
- Two faults that only showed once the grip worked. Making a window unresizable pins its size to
  whatever it measured at that moment, which was the window before it was docked — so every time
  the shell moved the band it was clamped back to that shape for a frame and then snapped to its
  previous thickness. And putting the band back while our own reservation call was still running
  could take the whole app down; that call is now left to finish.
- **In a thin band, the count of running sessions is below the gauges rather than under them.** The
  gauge row takes whatever height is left, but a gauge has a height of its own, so in a short band
  the cards ran past the bottom of their row and were drawn straight over the line beneath. The row
  now keeps what overflows to itself.

## v2.11.2

- **The caption arrow says what the window is actually doing.** Two paths — the band restored at
  start-up, and the one re-applied when a monitor comes or goes — never told the window, so the
  arrow could offer to dock a window that was already a band, and the title bar stayed undraggable
  for one that was not. Whether the window is a band is now pushed on every change, from the one
  place that knows, and asked for once when the page first draws.
- **Inside, the app is now eight features on one bridge.** Projects, dock, git, usage, metrics,
  clipboard, updates and settings each own their channels, their main-process side and their part
  of the page in one folder; the bridge the page talks through is derived from those contracts, and
  a test pins every key the page can reach. Nothing is meant to look or behave differently — the
  point is that a change to one feature now touches that feature. The settings screen is the same
  cards; each card's body belongs to its feature.

## v2.11.1

- **The strip of desktop along a docked band is gone.** It appeared in v2.11.0 and the runtime is
  why: Windows gives every window an invisible resize border, seven pixels on three sides, and
  Electron 33 painted right out to the window's edge while 43 paints only to the inner one. A band
  is placed on the rectangle it reserved, so those seven pixels showed the wallpaper through.
  Measured on the same code with only the runtime swapped: on 33 the painted rectangle and the
  window's own are identical; on 43 they differ by exactly that border.
  The band is now placed grown by the difference, which puts the invisible part off the edge of the
  screen and the painted edge exactly on the reservation. The difference is asked of the window
  itself each time, so on a runtime that paints to the outer edge this is the same call as before.

## v2.11.0

- **Runs on Electron 43.** The line the app was on last had a security release in April 2025, so it
  had been carrying an unpatched Chromium and an end-of-life Node for over a year. Nothing about the
  app is meant to look different.
- **Docking had to be taught where the window is.** From Electron 43 `getBounds()` answers with the
  frame you can see, which is inset by the invisible resize border Windows puts around a resizable
  window — seven or eight pixels a side. A docked band is placed on the rectangle it reserved, in
  physical pixels, so comparing the two never matched: the band would decide it had been moved, put
  itself back, and be woken again by the event its own placement raised. It now asks Windows for the
  window's rectangle and compares like with like.
- **A band could be asked for one size and answer with another.** Reserving an edge takes the best
  part of half a second and moves every window on the desktop; during that the window is still the
  old band while the reservation is already the new one. Since both span the same edge, that read as
  the user having dragged the thickness, and a request for 20 % was answered by saving back 12 %.
  The window in which the shell is allowed to argue now opens before the reservation, not after it.
- The "Add a project" folder picker starts beside the project used most recently. Electron 43 changed
  the default from the last folder you were in to Downloads, which is nowhere near where code lives.
- CI runs the whole suite on Node 22.
- Two testing repairs while in here: the docking assertions ask the operating system for the window
  rectangle rather than Electron, since Electron no longer reports it; and the band-size test waits
  for the band to actually change before measuring it, instead of for a work area that had already
  shrunk on the previous step — which is what made it fail about one run in three.

## v2.10.0

- **A session is called what Claude Code calls it.** The terminal tab has always shown a tidied
  title — `apiFuncGetStatus vs apiFuncGetSegmentStatus 차이` — while this app showed the raw
  question it was typed as. That title is in the transcript all along, as an `ai-title` entry
  rewritten as the conversation grows; the newest one is now what a row says. A name you chose still
  wins over it, and the original question is still kept and still searchable.
- **This app was destroying that title.** Reopening a session passed its own row text to Claude Code
  as `--name`, which is stored as a *custom* title — so the raw question overwrote the good one
  permanently, in Claude Code's own tab and `/resume` picker as well as here. `--name` is now passed
  only for a session you actually renamed. If one was already overwritten, renaming it to an empty
  name gives the generated title back.
- **Files with no conversation in them are no longer listed.** Claude Code leaves behind a
  few-hundred-byte transcript holding only a title whenever the talking ends up in another file;
  there was nothing in one to open. A file too large to read in one go is never treated this way, so
  a long session cannot be hidden by mistake.
- Titles no longer come from `history.jsonl`, which turned out not to be reliable per session: the
  first prompt of one session here is filed in it under a different session id that has no
  transcript at all. It is now only a fallback.
- Note that `/clear` genuinely starts a new session — a new id and a new transcript — so it still
  adds a row. Those rows are real and resumable, and Claude Code's own `/resume` lists them too;
  they just read as separate pieces of work now instead of near-duplicates.

## v2.9.1

- **Updating itself works again — it never had.** Windows releases carried three different names for
  the same installer: electron-builder built `Hangar Setup 2.9.0.exe`, wrote the space-to-dash form
  `Hangar-Setup-2.9.0.exe` into `latest.yml`, and GitHub stored the uploaded file as
  `Hangar.Setup.2.9.0.exe`, because it turns spaces into dots. The updater asked for the dashed name
  and got a 404 every time, silently, on every release so far. The installer is named without spaces
  now, so all three agree. Linux was never affected — those names had no spaces to begin with.
  An installed copy reads the newest release's metadata on each check, so existing installations
  reach this one and are fixed from here on.
- **A release cannot break that way again unnoticed**: after publishing, CI compares every `url:` in
  `latest*.yml` against the assets GitHub actually hosts, and fails the run if one is missing. The
  check has to live after the upload, because that is where the renaming happens.
- **CI asks for far less.** Write access to the repository is granted to the publish job alone
  instead of to every job in the file, tag names reach scripts through the environment rather than
  being spliced into a shell command, and the four GitHub actions are pinned to commit hashes rather
  than to tags that can be moved under us.
- Node 20 in CI reached end of life in April; the workflow builds on 22.
- Paths in comments, tests and the changelog use a placeholder account name.

## v2.9.0

- **Every question the app asks is drawn in the app.** Deleting a project or a session, naming a
  branch, confirming a forced removal: all of it now appears inside the window, in its theme and its
  language, instead of a system box wearing the OS's own colours. This also fixed a feature that had
  never worked — Electron does not implement `window.prompt`, so the branch-name question returned
  nothing and creating a worktree quietly did nothing at all. The folder picker stays native, because
  a file dialog is the system's to draw.
- **A worktree sits under the repository it came from**, indented, directly beneath it, rather than
  as a sibling row that hides the relationship. The parent is read from the pointer in the worktree's
  own `.git` file, which costs nothing. Matching the two needed a resolved real path: git writes
  `C:/Users/ExampleUser/…` where a transcript can hold the 8.3 form `C:\Users\EXAMPL~1\…`, and
  as strings those never meet.
- **A project's detail panel lists the repository's other checkouts**, marking the one you are on.
- The `worktree` chip and the memory gauge read as English in every language: they name a git concept
  and a machine reading, and "CPU" beside "메모리" looked like two unrelated things.
- A pin test that only failed in a full run is deterministic now: it stamped one file's time and
  trusted the clock for the other, so which project counted as newer depended on how fast the suite
  had been running.

## v2.8.0

Everything here came from running the app on a second machine, where most of it did not work.

### Usage, which was never going to work anywhere else

- **Hangar collects the usage figures itself, if you let it.** The gauges read
  `cache/rate-limits.json`, and nothing in a stock install writes that file — it existed on the
  author's machine because a personal status-line script happened to publish it. Claude Code hands
  its Stop hook the current rate limits at the end of every turn, so **Settings · Usage** can install
  a small hook that writes them down. It is off until asked for, says exactly which files it touches,
  leaves any hook already there alone, and removes what it added. No credentials are read and nothing
  is sent anywhere.
- The hook needs no bash and no curl: a `cmd` script reading stdin through `more.com` on Windows, a
  `sh` script of builtins elsewhere. The path it writes is fixed at install time, because Claude Code
  keys its home off `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and this app off `CLAUDE_HOME` — a script that worked it out
  at run time published where nothing was reading.
- Turning it on no longer risks the user's `settings.json`: a file that will not parse stops the
  operation instead of being replaced by ours.

### A shell that is actually installed

- **PowerShell 7 → Windows PowerShell → cmd, in that order, using whichever is there.** Availability
  was never passed to the launcher, so Auto always chose `pwsh.exe` and a machine without PowerShell 7
  simply failed to open a session. An explicit choice is now a preference too: settings made on one
  machine still open a session on another, and the fallback is reported rather than silent.

### Git

- **A project row shows its branch** — `main ●3`, read straight from `.git`, which costs nothing.
  Counting changed files runs `git status` for the selected project only.
- **Update from the base branch**, from a project's right-click menu: rebase, merge, or fast-forward
  only. The base is fetched into a private ref first, so a concurrent fetch cannot move it mid-rebase,
  and a conflict stops and leaves the repository alone.
- **On its own, if you want it.** Never, only when it fast-forwards, or using the strategy above. Any
  project with a session running in it, or with uncommitted changes, is skipped whatever the setting.
- **Worktrees.** A project with a repository can grow a worktree on a new branch, which joins the list
  as its own project — a second place to run a session on the same repository. New branches are cut
  with `--no-track`, or `git status` reports them behind the base before they have been pushed, and
  the base is resolved to a full ref so a tag of the same name cannot stand in for it. Removing one
  refuses while it holds uncommitted work, and asks before forcing.
- Where git is not installed, the branch still shows and the rest says so, with a link to install it.

### Updates

- **Hangar updates itself**, through electron-updater and the releases it already publishes.
  **Settings · Updates** chooses automatic or manual and has a Check now button that reports what it
  found, downloads with a progress figure, and installs on restart. Releases now carry the metadata
  that makes this possible, so updating in place works from this version onwards.

### Language

- **한국어.** English by default, Korean available, and a fresh install follows the machine's own
  language. Menus, tooltips, settings and relative times all go through the dictionary; the Korean is
  written as Korean rather than translated word for word. A test scans the source for English left in
  the markup, because three rounds of "there is still English in the settings" is enough.

### Fixed

- **Every settings section is saved.** The save call listed sections by hand and two of them — git and
  updates — were missing, so those choices reverted the moment the main process pushed the settings
  back. Reported as "rebase cannot be selected".
- **A session opened from Hangar is a top-level session**, whatever started Hangar. Launched from
  inside a Claude Code session, the app inherited that session's environment markers and passed them
  on; the new `claude` read them as its own and stopped saving its transcript. Those markers are
  stripped now.
- **The terminal tab and the row say the same thing.** The session's name is passed to `--name`, which
  Claude Code puts in its prompt box, its `/resume` picker and the tab title.

## v2.7.0

- **A project can be added before it has a session.** The list only ever knew folders Claude Code
  had already written a transcript for, so a new folder had to be started from a terminal first. The
  **+** beside the search box opens a folder picker; the folder joins the list at once, selected,
  and its first session can be started from there.
- **New session, as a button**, on both screens, with `N` as its key — the sessions screen had
  `Enter` and `O` to resume the one under the cursor, and nothing to start a fresh one.
- **Right-click menus on every row.** A project offers open sessions, new session (here or in a new
  window), rename, show folder and delete; a session offers resume (here or in a new window), rename
  and delete. Each names the row it was opened on, so it works on a row that was not selected.
- **Pin to top.** In that menu, for projects and sessions alike: a pinned row stays at the head of its
  list, marked with a pin, until it is unpinned. Pins are kept in `config/manager.json`.
- **A leaner toolbar.** **Back** and **Open** are gone: the project list is always one click away and
  `Esc`/`←` still go back, while a row's double-click or `Enter` was already what Open did.
- **A session opened from Hangar is a top-level session, whatever started Hangar.** Started from
  inside a Claude Code session — `claude --p` at its prompt, or a tool call — the app inherited that
  session's environment markers and passed them on, and the new `claude` took itself for a child
  session: "Transcript saving is off — inherited CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION marker". Those markers
  are now stripped from the environment of every session launched; a user's own `CLAUDE_CODE_*`
  settings pass through.

## v2.6.3

- **Upright gauges keep their second reading.** Standing a card up dropped everything but the
  percentage: an upright CPU card lost its clock speed and memory lost the quantity. All four now
  carry it on a line of its own — `31%` over `1.8 GHz`, `34%` over `↻ 2h 11m`.
- **The docked band shows all four gauges instead of scrolling two of them out of sight.** A band is
  short, not narrow, and the gauges were stacked down a column: in a 320 px strip the machine graphs
  fell off the bottom. They now lie across the panel, upright and side by side, with the running
  count under them.

## v2.6.2

- **An upright usage bar still says when the window frees up.** Narrowing the pane stood the rate
  cards up and dropped the reset line with the rest of the text — losing the one thing the gauge is
  consulted for. The upright card now carries the time remaining (`↻ 2h 11m`) under the percentage,
  with the exact clock time still in the tooltip.

## v2.6.1

- **A card at the boundary no longer flickers between its two shapes.** Standing a card upright
  frees width, which put it back over the threshold, which laid it down again — one threshold
  cannot decide a question whose answer changes the measurement. Going upright now happens below
  132 px and lying back across only above 168 px, so a card at any width settles.
- **Memory reads as a share as well as a quantity** — `47% · 15 GB` beside CPU's `27% · 1.7 GHz`,
  so both machine gauges answer the same two questions.

## v2.6.0

A day of living in the docked band, fixing what it made visible.

### The window

- **Docking has its own caption button** — leftmost, before the three the OS always has. Maximise
  and docking used to share a button, so "restore" gave back a screen edge in one state and a window
  size in the other; now maximise always means fill the screen, restore always means the last window
  size, and the dock button toggles the band. Its glyph is drawn for the configured edge: a wall on
  that side, an arrow into it to dock, out of it to undock.
- **Undocking puts the window back on screen.** Releasing the band used to leave the window exactly
  where the band was — a strip pressed against the edge, sometimes past it. It now returns to the
  remembered window rectangle, or centred at the default size, clamped inside the work area either
  way. Maximising from a docked state gets the same placement first, so the restore after it has a
  window shape to come back to.
- **The title bar is a title bar**: icon, name, version, caption buttons. Keys moved off button faces
  into tooltips.

### Usage and monitoring

- **The usage gauges moved off the title bar**, where a narrow window cut them off, and sit with the
  CPU and memory graphs in every shape — same cards, same format. **Settings · Status line** ticks
  which windows are drawn.
- **The CPU clock is live now.** `os.cpus()` reports the figure the registry was given at boot — a
  flat 2995 MHz on all twenty cores here while the real clock swung — so the reading came from PDH's
  `% Processor Performance` times the base clock instead, the same sum Task Manager shows. Verified
  against a one-core burner (expected 5.0 % of 20 cores, read 4.9 %) and an independent
  measurement of a live session's tree (5.8 % vs 4.6 %).
- **Memory says what it is out of** (`12 GB / 31.7 GB`), and the label is Memory, not Mem — the
  abbreviation only appears where the card is too narrow for the word.
- **Narrow cards shrink first, then stand up.** Cards share the row's width evenly however many
  there are; below reading width each becomes an upright bar with the short label, and the full
  reading lives in its tooltip.
- **A live session row draws CPU and memory as separate sparklines**, each with its own number, on a
  shared baseline with headroom — one line no longer rides the canvas top while the other sits on
  the bottom border.
- **Rows wrap instead of overlapping.** Too narrow for a name and its numbers on one line, the
  numbers drop to a second line; the thresholds are measured per row kind, because a live session
  row carries 324 px of fixed content and a project row about 110.
- **The per-model weekly gauges are gone.** Verified against the real payload with Fable 5 running:
  Claude Code sends `five_hour` and `seven_day`, and nothing else — so the Fable/Opus and Sonnet
  windows could never draw, and only made the settings list lie.
- **The Outlook and ponytail segments are gone** for the same reason as MCP before them: each read a
  cache only this one machine's own scripts write.

### Settings and launch

- **Pane sizes are remembered as fractions of the window**, saved as you let go of the divider — a
  pixel count set in a wide window was wrong in a docked band, which is how the stacked sessions
  pane ended up eight pixels tall.
- **Custom program means a program like VS Code**: opening a session starts it on the project folder
  — no terminal around it, no claude command passed, which such a program would read as files to
  open. An empty path still falls back to Auto.
- The launch screen now says plainly that the automatic screenshot path has **no shortcut of its
  own** — plain Ctrl+V is the whole gesture — and that Ctrl+Alt+V is a fallback for a clipboard that
  already carries text.
- The stack-below slider is gone from Layout: auto simply stacks when the window is narrow.

## v2.5.1

Both faults were found by living with a docked band, and both are fixed with a case that fails
without the fix.

- **Stacked: entering a project shows its sessions again.** The divider between the project list and
  the sessions is remembered in pixels, and a docked band is usually far shorter than the window it
  was set in — 661 px of project list in a 762 px band left the sessions eight pixels of room, which
  reads as nothing at all. The remembered height is still kept, and still used in full wherever it
  fits; what is drawn is now cut to the space the two panes actually share, measured rather than
  guessed, so the lower pane is never smaller than a list.

- **Dragging a band's grip moves it the distance you dragged.** Re-asserting the band — the guard
  that undoes what the shell does to it behind our back — was also undoing each step of a drag in
  progress, putting the window back to the size it had before the drag started. Measured on a
  left-hand band: a 120 px drag moved it 48 px, the few steps that happened to land between two
  corrections. Re-asserting now stands aside while the hand is on the grip. Verified across both
  monitors on all four edges: 120 px dragged, 120 px given, and the far edge never moves.

## v2.5.0

- **A docked band cannot be dragged or pulled off its edge, and does not pretend it can.** Docking
  is the maximised state, so the title bar no longer drags the window and the frame no longer
  resizes at all — Windows draws the resize cursor for every side of a frame at once, so the only
  way to stop three sides offering a resize that cannot happen was to stop the frame resizing and
  give the fourth side a grip of its own. Measured: arrow on all four sides of the frame, and the
  resize cursor only on the band's inner edge.
- **Resizing the band no longer jumps or flickers.** Two faults, both measured on a top-docked band:
  settling a drag re-applied the whole dock, which recomputed the band from a percentage rounded to
  a whole number and placed the window up to twenty pixels from where the drag ended; and the new
  reservation was asked for at the window's own position, which the shell answers with the free
  space **below the band's existing reservation** — so the band walked down the screen by its own
  height, `y = -81` becoming `y = 499`. The band is now reserved anchored to its edge at exactly the
  thickness dragged to, and the window is not moved at all unless the shell insists.
- **Every usage window says when it resets** — in the docked band too, which used to drop it for
  want of room, and that is the shape the app is left in all day. The reading leads with the time
  left rather than a bare clock time, because "when does this free up" is the question a percentage
  provokes: `9% ↻ 4h 43m left · 19:00`. A weekly window counts in days, not in three-digit hours.
- **The usage strip is legible from across the desk.** The percentage went from 12 px to 16 px and
  the bar from 6 px to 10 px tall, with brighter labels.
- **The MCP segment is gone.** Claude Code exposes no live MCP state, so the dot could only report a
  separate handshake against one configured server — it never moved when a server was reconnected in
  the session, which is the only thing it was being read for. Its settings section went with it.

## v2.4.0

- **Your ordinary paste key now works for screenshots.** Copy one and Hangar writes it out and
  leaves the clipboard holding both the picture and that file's path, so Ctrl+V in a terminal
  pastes the path while Ctrl+V in an image editor still pastes the image — each window takes the
  format it understands. Nothing is intercepted, so no other application's paste is affected, and
  the shortcut remains for a clipboard that already carries text. **Settings · Launch** turns it
  off; the last 50 screenshots are kept and older ones are cleared out. Windows only.
- **The paste shortcut now actually pastes.** It was sending Ctrl+V about 60 ms after the shortcut
  fired — while the hand that pressed Ctrl+Alt+V was still on those keys, so the terminal received
  Ctrl+Alt+V, which is not paste, and nothing appeared. The image was saved and the path was on the
  clipboard the whole time, which is why it looked like nothing had happened at all. Hangar now
  waits for the modifiers to come up before it sends anything (up to 1.2 s, then sends regardless
  rather than swallowing the paste). Measured: a 250 ms hold pasted nothing before, the path after.

## v2.3.1

- **The paste shortcut says what happened.** It is pressed in another window, so a toast inside
  Hangar was the same as saying nothing: there is now a desktop notification either way — the image
  is ready, or there was none on the clipboard — and Settings says plainly when another application
  is holding the shortcut. (Hangar has to be running for it to work at all, which the screen now
  also says.)
- **A Back button on the settings screen**, since `Esc` is only obvious to someone who already knows
  it. `Esc` still works.
- A cut-off label carries its tooltip in the same frame it is cut, not one render later — and the
  test that checks it now names the labels that went quiet instead of counting them.
- The window no longer grows by three pixels each time it is reopened: the saved rectangle was
  restored through the constructor, which does not measure a window the same way `setBounds` does.

## v2.3.0

- **Paste a screenshot into a terminal session.** A terminal cannot take a bitmap, so copying a
  screenshot used to mean saving it somewhere by hand and typing the path. Press **Ctrl+Alt+V** in
  the terminal instead: Hangar writes the clipboard's image out, puts that file's path on the
  clipboard, and sends the paste — the path lands where the cursor already is, ready for Claude Code
  to open. The shortcut is a setting (Launch), and `V` in Hangar's own window does the same thing
  without the keystroke.
- **A docked band has no border of its own.** Measured against the desktop: the top row, the bottom
  row and about three columns at each side were the wallpaper showing through — Windows 11's 1 px
  border and rounded corners. Docked, the window is told to have neither, so the band ends exactly
  where the screen does.

## v2.2.5

- **A loading window, in the order you would expect**: it appears first and alone — measured at
  340 ms from launch, which is as soon as Electron can draw anything — names each step while the app
  starts hidden behind it, and is closed as the app's own window is shown, once that window has
  actually rendered. Nothing half-drawn appears on the way.
- **Each MCP server has its own indicator.** "MCP ✔" answered a question nobody asked; every checked
  server now gets its own dot and its own tooltip — connected, not responding, or never probed.
- **Launch · Custom program**: name the executable that hosts a session, and it is started with the
  claude command as its arguments. Left empty it behaves as Auto, so a session still opens.

## v2.2.4

- **Docked is the maximised state, and now behaves like one.** The maximise button docks — back to
  the band this arrangement remembers — and restore undocks into an ordinary resizable window. While
  docked the window is not movable and not maximisable, so it cannot be dragged off its edge at all;
  putting it back on every move event was fighting the window manager's own drag loop instead.
- **The loading panel is the window itself.** A second window meant a second renderer starting up
  beside the app's own — 800 ms — so the "loading" window arrived after the loading. The panel is
  markup in the page, painted when the document parses, and the window is shown the moment it is
  created: measured **1,000 ms → about 500 ms** from launch, with the taskbar button showing
  progress from that same moment.
- **Text that does not fit says the whole of itself on hover** — measured rather than guessed, so a
  label only carries a tooltip when it is really cut off. The MCP segment lists every server it was
  asked about with its verdict, one per line.
- **The splash arrives about twice as early.** It was waiting for its page to load — 800 ms, because
  its renderer was starting up beside the app's own — and only then appearing. The window is shown
  the moment it is created, painted by the compositor from its background colour, with the text
  filling in behind it: measured 1,000 ms → 400-550 ms from launch.

## v2.2.3

Everything the 2.x line changed, in one place — the terminal manager became a desktop app, and the
faults found while living with it were fixed.

### The app

**Claude Projects became Hangar**, an Electron + TypeScript desktop app for Windows and Linux with
every feature and every key of the terminal version. The name is Hangar; *for Claude Code* is a
subtitle, never part of the name or the appId, so a third-party tool does not read as an official
one. The Python terminal version remains downloadable as **v1.15.0**.

- **No title bar.** The caption buttons are drawn in the app's own header, so a docked window fills
  its band edge to edge. Docked counts as the maximised state: the middle button offers to restore,
  and restoring is what gives the edge back.
- **Four shapes, chosen by the window's own size** — full, compact, a band for a top/bottom dock,
  and a stacked column. **Settings · Layout** picks side-by-side, stacked, or stacked below a width
  you choose. Every pane can be dragged to any width, and the stacked layout has its own divider.
- **Light, dark and system themes**, the system one following the OS without a restart.
- **A splash while it starts**, naming each step, and only when starting takes longer than 450 ms.
- Usage bars for the 5 h, 7 d and weekly Fable/Opus and Sonnet windows, each percentage beside the
  bar it measures, with a refresh button; every segment of the strip — usage, Outlook, ponytail, and
  each MCP server — can be turned on or off.
- **Everything is remembered**: window size and position, pane widths, theme, layout, the shell and
  permission mode, and the dock — per monitor *and* per monitor arrangement, so plugging a screen in
  or out brings back that setup.

### Docking

The band is genuinely reserved — an application desktop toolbar on Windows, `_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL`
on X11 — so a maximised window stops at it. Wayland cannot do this for an ordinary application, and
says so instead of pretending. Faults fixed along the way, each with a test that fails without it:

- The band **fills exactly what it reserved**: Windows enforces a window's minimum size and drags it
  back inside the work area unless both are handled.
- The edge is **given back the moment the window closes**, synchronously — an async release loses the
  race with process exit. A forced kill leaks nothing either; Windows reclaims it.
- **A percentage means the same thing every time.** Three faults compounded into a band that grew on
  its own — 12 % became 26 %, then 35 %, then 53 %.
- **A second monitor works.** Electron's display ids are not stable between runs, so a dock saved for
  the second screen came back on the first; and the DIP-to-pixel conversion used the scale of the
  monitor the *window* was on, not the one being docked to.
- **A resized band stays on its edge** instead of drifting inwards, and **dragging or maximising a
  docked window keeps it docked** — only restoring undocks.
- A dock change made in **Settings** sticks rather than being overridden on the next read.

### Speed

The window used to freeze for tens of seconds. Three causes, all measured:

- A project on an unreachable network share made every scan wait for the SMB timeout — **10.9 s**,
  on the thread that draws the window. Reachability is now answered by a background probe.
- Reading a transcript's first line read the whole file: 48 MB, 23 MB, 20 MB, once per scan. Only
  the first 64 KB is read, and the answer is kept — **a scan went from 21 s to 36 ms**.
- Registering or removing the band makes the shell tell every window on the desktop; that call runs
  on a worker thread now.

**Monitoring costs about 3 % of one core.** The obvious library for it shelled out to WMI —
`processes()` measured 3.6 s per call and `mem()` 3.3 s, once a second — so every reading is taken
in-process (a toolhelp snapshot and `GetProcessTimes` on Windows, `/proc` on Linux, `os.cpus()` for
the machine) on a worker thread. Each running session's whole process tree is sampled once a second
and drawn in its row, with the machine's CPU, clock speed and memory beside the list.
**Settings · Monitoring** turns it off entirely — the timer stops, not just the drawing.

## v1.15.0

- The size setting stops at what the terminal will actually do. Once a refusal has been measured on
  an axis, that floor becomes the lower bound — stepping down stops there instead of changing a
  number nothing acts on — and the row states it: `38 %  →  583 px  min 38 % (terminal floor 580 px)`.
- Opening the settings screen raises a saved size that is under the floor and says so, so what the
  screen shows is what docking will give you.

## v1.14.0

- A left or right dock that seemed to ignore the size setting now explains itself. Windows Terminal
  refuses to shrink past a minimum that depends on its font (measured 580 px here), so every
  percentage below that produced the same window. The manager remembers that floor per axis and
  shows it beside the size — `20 %  →  307 px  ! terminal floor 580 px` — instead of promising a
  width the terminal will not give.
- The floor is stored per axis in `config/manager.json`, so the warning is there before you apply.

## v1.13.0

- **Narrow windows no longer tear the frame.** List rows had minimum column widths that made them
  wider than their box below about 45 columns, so every row wrapped and overlapped the borders.
  Columns are dropped as the window narrows — memory flag, then date, then count, then the path —
  and the name keeps what is left; a dropped column now renders as nothing instead of a stray `…`.
- Box titles, framed rows and detail labels are clamped to the width they actually have, and the
  settings screen never draws more rows than the window is tall.
- Checked across 165 size combinations from 200×60 down to 12×6: nothing exceeds the frame.

## v1.12.0

- Everything the manager remembers now lives in one file, `config/manager.json`, with a section per
  feature (`dock`, `status`, `launch`, `ui`). Settings written by an older build are still read from
  their single-purpose files until the section exists, so nothing is lost on upgrade.
- **Where you were is remembered too**: the project that was open and the row the cursor was on come
  back on the next start.

## v1.11.0

- Sessions start from the resolved `claude` executable with the flags appended, instead of the bare
  name. A `claude` function in the user's PowerShell profile (the `claudex` wrapper, for one)
  outranks the executable in that shell, so the permission mode the manager set could be replaced by
  whatever the wrapper forwarded; now `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions …` means exactly that.

## v1.10.0

- **Much faster redraws.** A frame no longer touches the filesystem: a project's folder check and
  last-used time are resolved by the scan, and an unreachable path (a UNC share whose host is off)
  is probed off the UI thread instead of stalling every row of every frame — 4.5 ms → 0.4 ms per
  frame here. Keystrokes that are already queued skip their frame, so holding a key no longer piles
  up redraws.
- Scanning is cheaper too: `history.jsonl` is only re-parsed when it changes and a transcript's
  folder is remembered per file, halving the idle refresh.
- **Renaming no longer duplicates the line.** A title that reached the end of the row made the
  terminal wrap and scroll, leaving a copy behind on every keystroke; the editor is now one row and
  scrolls sideways, showing the end of what you are typing.
- **The dock is remembered per monitor** — edge, size and on/off belong to the display, and moving
  the cursor in the monitor list shows what that monitor would go back to. Monitors with saved
  settings are marked `(saved)`.

## v1.9.0

- The exe carries a full Windows version resource, so File properties → Details is filled in:
  company and copyright **kimssi-labs** (MIT), product and description, internal and original
  filename, and the version — both File and Product.
- `__version__` in the source is the single origin of that version; `--version` prints it, and CI
  refuses a tag that disagrees with the source, `pyproject.toml`, or the built exe.

## v1.8.0

- **Settings · Permissions**: the mode every session opened from the manager starts in — Ask
  (default), Bypass permissions, Accept edits, Plan, or Auto. Launching the exe directly used to
  mean plain `claude`; the mode is now a setting rather than something only the `claude --p` wrapper
  could pass.
- A mode already given on the command line (`claudex --p`) still wins, and the box says so instead
  of showing a setting that is being overridden.
- Saved in `config/manager-launch.json` next to the shell choice.

## v1.7.0

- The detail box now reports everything the manager knows about the highlighted row, one labelled
  field per fact: a project shows its alias and real folder, path (called out in red when the folder
  is gone), session count with how many are running and their total size, last use, whether a
  `memory/` folder would be deleted with it, and its encoded directory; a session adds whether the
  title is a name or its first prompt, the prompt itself when a name replaced it, when it started,
  its state, and which project it belongs to.
- `--uninstall` no longer prints "removed" when the folder could not be deleted — a manager window
  still running from it now says so.

## v1.6.0

- `--install` adds a Start-menu entry (copying the exe to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\ClaudeProjects`),
  which is what makes *Pin to taskbar* available — Windows 11 offers that verb only from the Start
  menu, and pinning the running window would pin Windows Terminal instead.
- `--uninstall` removes the entry again.

## v1.5.0

- The screen redraws itself every 15 s while idle, so the status line no longer shows values from
  whenever a key was last pressed — a rolled 5 h or 7 d window, and sessions that started or ended
  meanwhile, now appear on their own.

## v1.4.0

- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` move between the settings group boxes; the `D` / `M` / `L` letter shortcuts are
  gone, so no key means two things depending on where you are.
- The project and session screens are drawn as group boxes too — the list in one, the detail viewer
  in the other — so every screen in the app now reads the same way.
- The box title carries where you are (project count and path, or the project's folder).

## v1.3.0

- Settings is one screen: **Dock**, **Status line** and **Launch** are each drawn in their own group
  box, all visible at once. The focused box expands; the other two collapse to a summary line.
- `D` / `M` / `L` switch between the boxes from anywhere on the screen.
- One cursor on screen at a time: `▸` marks the focused row, `[x]` marks what is chosen.

## v1.2.0

- **Settings · Launch**: choose the shell that hosts an opened session — Auto (PowerShell 7 when
  installed, else Windows PowerShell), PowerShell 7, Windows PowerShell, Command Prompt, or no shell
  at all (the tab then closes with `claude`).
- A choice whose executable is missing is marked `(not found)` instead of failing when a session is
  opened.
- Saved in `config/manager-launch.json`.

## v1.1.0

- **Settings · Status line**: pick which MCP servers the 🤖 segment reports on, from the servers
  found in `~/.claude.json` and in the probe cache. Each row shows its current verdict.
- The segment reads ✔ when every checked server is healthy, ✘ when one is failing, and a dim `?`
  when a checked server has no verdict yet; unchecking all of them hides it.
- No selection keeps the previous behaviour of reporting every server. Saved in
  `config/manager-status.json`.

## v1.0.0

First public release.

- Project list (last used first) with a live-session mark, session count, memory flag, and the
  session list behind `Enter`.
- Resume, open, rename and delete, each in a tab of the `Claude` window (`Enter`), the current
  window (`T`) or a new window (`O`).
- Renaming a session writes the same `custom-title.json` Claude Code's `/rename` writes, so the new
  title also shows in `/resume`.
- Detail viewer under the list, optional status line (rate limits, MCP, Outlook, ponytail), AppBar
  docking, and Korean-IME-safe keys.
- Single-file `ClaudeProjects.exe`, standard library only.
